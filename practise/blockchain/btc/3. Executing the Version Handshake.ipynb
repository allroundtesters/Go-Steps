    "We were able to entice a response from our peer and then decode it. However, three problems remain:\n",
    "1. Our initial `version` message payload is hardcoded. We should be able to construct it using any parameters we like.\n",
    "2. After receiving our peer's `version` response, we don't listen for their `verack` response as the [version handshake](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Version_Handshake) says we should.\n",
    "3. We don't send our `verack` upon receipt of our peer's `verack`, the final step in the handshake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we fix all these problems our program will be able to join the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network just like a [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) full node does.  We won't be able to participate nearly as fully or effectively as Bitcoin Core node, but it's a start!\n",
    "\n",
    "The last 2 problems simple fixes, since the `Verack` message [is so simple](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#verack). \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem #1 will be more involved. We've spent a lot of time learning to _deserialize_ Bitcoin network messages -- to turn raw bytes into Python objects. The 3rd problem demands we do the opposite: _serialize_ Bitcoin messages, to turn Python objects into raw bytes that can be sent over the network to our peers, who may not even have Python installed!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever done any web development I'm sure you've learned to serialize and deserialize JSON, which is the de facto data representation in this arena. Bitcoin is no different, but it uses raw bytes instead of JSON. Pretty simple.\n",

And we can tell them we haven't started syncing the blockchain yet: `start_height=0`.\n",

    "Similarly, `Version.from_bytes` takes the `payload` bytes of a `Packet` instance and turns it into a Python `Version` class, and `Version.to_bytes` will take a `Version` instance and turn it into `bytes`-representation in order to include it as the `payload` of an outgoing `Packet`."
